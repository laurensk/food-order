# Food-Order

**Warning: Please don't try this at home!**

I really can't describe this project correctly, but I'll try: This is a fully fledged food ordering system built with the newest technology. It combines a highly scalable database structure with a beautiful web interface.

Some disadvantages, which won't be a problem:
- Uses **MS Access** as database.
- Only works with **Internet Explorer**.
